Current List of TODO in partial order: 

1. Everyone : Figure out how on earth to get an ios app up and running, get the basics of swift going on 
2. Whoever is on UI: start figuring out how to code swift UI stuff and find a few color pallets/ design stuff to float to the team.
3. Database folks: Decide on a db file format, figure out how to write/read files in IOS, get a general recipe format going and create a few example recipes for everyone to use. (Priority) 
4. Web Scraper/Parser folks: figure out what libraries we are gonna use to do this task and whether or not we need a web server. IF we need a web server got to get on that hot quick. 
5. Someone Figure out what AI api we are going to use for start (Note this is just a stopgap for our minimal viable product), needs to be relatively accurate and dependable.
6. Whole Team (Or whoever is really passionate about it): Float some stick models of UX, i.e here is the home screen, we want this navbar, etc. 

Currently Working On / Interested in:
- Febie is working on figuring out the standard way of measuring quantities to store in the database. (i.e cups, 1 bannana etc)
- Ben is working on figuring out what libraries if any we can use for parsing/scraping on ios
- Anna is working on the recipe parser script (basic functionality is there, but trying to refine and catch more edge cases)
